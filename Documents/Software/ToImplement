Client part will consist of 4 controllers (probably attiny13).
Each controller will maintain two devices: servo and DC motor.
Servo will recieve PWM signal with period 20 ms (50 Hz).
DC motor will be driven using H-bridge witch requires 2 analog signals.
To generate analog signals from controller will be used sowtware PWM with RC filter.
Software PWM without using timer can be implemented in two ways.
First way. Get normalized random number, compare it with required signal amplitude, if number is grater - enable pin, disable otherwise.
- requires random number genarator
- will be interrupted
+ high frequency pwm easy to filter

Second way. Send a saw-shaped signal to ADC pin. If value of the decoded signal is grater - enable pin, disable otherwise.
- requires additional saw-shape generator

Saw-shaped signal can be obtained by integrating CLK signal but it shuld be at least 512 times slower than CPU frequency.

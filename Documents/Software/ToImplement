Client part will consist of 5 controllers (attiny25) four "feathers" and one "keel".
Each of 4 "feather" controllers will maintain two devices: servo and DC motor. - WIP
One "keel" controller will maintain tranciever through SPI and 4 controllers through USI, being master on both interfaces. - TODO

Servo will recieve PWM signal with period 20 ms (50 Hz). - LOW PRIO
DC motor will be driven using H-bridge witch requires 2 PWM signals. - DONE

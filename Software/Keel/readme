"Keel" is a bridge between tranceiver (through SPI) that operates in receiver mode, converts data to USI. 
Generates CLK frequency, configures receiver and monitors its status.

Start
Configure cpu (frequency, timers, ports, interrupts)
Wait for other devices to awake
Start CLK
Init Dendrite recreiver (power up, interrupts, frequency, enable receiver)
Enter main loop and wait for interrupts
If stream buffer has data write it to the Axon software SPI transmitter

When interrupt is generated by Dendrite receiver send requests to read data
Acquire data and write it to stream
Send Dendrite request to disable interrupt flag

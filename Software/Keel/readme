"Keel" is a bridge between tranceiver (through SPI) that operates in receiver mode, converts data to USI. 
Generates CLK frequency, configures receiver and monitors its status.

Start
Configure cpu (frequency, timers, ports, interrupts) - DONE
Wait for other devices to awake - DONE
Start CLK - DONE
Init Dendrite recreiver (power up, interrupts, frequency, enable receiver)
Enter main loop and wait for interrupts	- DONE
If stream buffer has data write it to the Axon software SPI transmitter - DONE

When interrupt is generated by Dendrite receiver send requests to read data
Acquire data and write it to stream
Send Dendrite request to disable interrupt flag
